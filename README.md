## Overview
This repository contains Lacework's integration with AWS Moose, a security data lake that is based on the [OCSF standard](https://schema.ocsf.io/).
Lacework integrates with â€œAWS MOOSE'' as a data source and provides our security findings that include software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and known and unknown threats.
